C# 2D Game Framework heavily inspired by the Java LibGDX Game Framework.

THis project was intended to be released into the world for people to use, and you can - when it's finished - if you
like.
Be Aware, though, that there is another, more complete, LibGDX C# conversion named
SharpGDX available.
SharpGDX has rendered this project largely redundant now, so I'm debating either:-

1. Ceasing development and abandonding the project.
2. Continuing the project for the purposes of improving my C# skills and knowledge.
3. Continuing the project and steering it away from LibGDX into an independant framework.

I'm more than a little bit annoyed and disappointed that this project has hit this particular wall.
