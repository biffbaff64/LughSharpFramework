Texture Coordinates: The most common reason is incorrect texture coordinates.

Range: Texture coordinates should typically be in the range [0.0, 1.0]. (0, 0) represents the bottom-left corner of the texture, and (1, 1) represents the top-right corner.
Mapping: Ensure that the texture coordinates are correctly mapped to the vertices of your geometry. If the mapping is incorrect, the texture will appear distorted or not at all.
Vertex Attribute: Double-check that you're setting up the texture coordinate vertex attribute correctly in your SetupVertexAttributes() method. Verify the attribute location, size (2 for vec2), stride, offset, and data type (GL_FLOAT).
Texture Binding and Activation:

Texture Unit: Ensure that you are activating the correct texture unit before binding the texture. Usually, you would use GL.ActiveTexture(TextureUnit.Texture0) to activate texture unit 0.
Texture Binding: Verify that you're binding the texture correctly using GL.BindTexture(TextureTarget.Texture2D, _textureId).
Texture Loading: Make sure the texture is loaded correctly. Check for errors during texture loading.
Shader Issues:

Sampler Uniform: Verify that you have a sampler uniform in your fragment shader to sample the texture. The sampler uniform should be of type sampler2D.
Uniform Location: Ensure that you're getting the correct location of the sampler uniform using GL.GetUniformLocation().
Uniform Value: Set the value of the sampler uniform to the correct texture unit index (usually 0) using GL.Uniform1i(samplerLocation, 0).
Texture Parameters:

Filtering: Check the texture filtering parameters. If the filtering is set incorrectly (e.g., to GL_NEAREST with a very low-resolution texture), the texture might appear blocky or distorted. GL_LINEAR or GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR are usually good choices.
Wrapping: Check the texture wrapping parameters. If the wrapping is set to GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE and your texture coordinates are outside the [0, 1] range, the texture will be clamped to the edge. GL_REPEAT is often used for repeating textures.
Debugging Steps:

Check Texture Coordinates: Print out the texture coordinates you're using to verify that they are in the correct range and mapped correctly.

Verify Texture Loading: If you're loading textures from files, check for errors during the loading process.

Simplify Shader: Use a very basic fragment shader that simply samples the texture:

OpenGL Shading Language

#version 450 core
in vec2 TexCoord;
out vec4 FragColor;
uniform sampler2D ourTexture;

void main()
{
FragColor = texture(ourTexture, TexCoord);
}
Check OpenGL Errors: Add GL.GetError() checks after every OpenGL call related to textures, including glActiveTexture, glBindTexture, glTexImage2D, glTexParameteri, and glUniform1i.

Hardcoded Texture Coordinates: Try using hardcoded texture coordinates (e.g., (0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (0, 1)) to rule out problems with the texture coordinate calculation.

Example Debugging (Texture Coordinates and Shader):

C#

// In SetupVertexAttributes():
int texCoordAttribute = shader.GetAttributeLocation("aTexCoord");
if (texCoordAttribute == -1) Logger.Error("Could not find aTexCoord attribute");
GL.EnableVertexAttribArray(texCoordAttribute);
GL.VertexAttribPointer(texCoordAttribute, 2, VertexAttribPointerType.Float, false, VERTEX_SIZE * sizeof(float), /* offset of texcoords */);

// In your rendering loop:
Console.WriteLine($"Texture Coordinates: ({texCoords[0]}, {texCoords[1]}), ({texCoords[2]}, {texCoords[3]}), ...");

// In your fragment shader:
#version 450 core
in vec2 TexCoord;
out vec4 FragColor;
uniform sampler2D ourTexture;

void main()
{
FragColor = texture(ourTexture, TexCoord);
//FragColor = vec4(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0); //Test colour
}
By carefully checking these points and using the debugging steps, you should be able to identify why your textures are not displaying correctly. If you can provide the relevant parts of your texture loading code, SetupVertexAttributes() method, and shader code, I can give you more specific guidance.
