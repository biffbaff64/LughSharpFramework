1.Vertex Data and Attributes:
------------------------------

**Vertex Format Mismatch:**
Ensure your C# vertex data structure (e.g., struct Vertex { Vector3 Position; float ColorPacked;
Vector2 TexCoords; }) exactly matches how you're setting up the vertex attributes in OpenGL using
GL.VertexAttribPointer. The stride and offset parameters are crucial.

**Interleaved vs. Separate Attributes:**
If you're using an interleaved format (position, color, texture coordinates all in one array), make sure
the stride and offset values in GL.VertexAttribPointer are calculated correctly.

**Vertex Coordinates:**
Ensure texture coordinates are within the range [0, 1]. (0,0) is top left and (1,1) is bottom right.

**Vertex Count and Indices:**
If using indexed drawing (GL.DrawElements), make sure your index buffer is set up correctly and that
the number of indices you're drawing is correct. If using non-indexed drawing (GL.DrawArrays), ensure
the vertex count is correct.

2.Shaders:
----------

**Shader Compilation Errors:**
Check for any errors during shader compilation or linking. Use GL.GetShaderInfoLog and GL.GetProgramInfoLog
to retrieve error messages.

**Input/Output Matching:**
Make sure the output of your vertex shader (e.g., v_texCoords, v_colorPacked) matches the input of your
fragment shader.

**Texture Sampler:**
In your fragment shader, ensure you're using the correct uniform sampler2D variable name and that you're
sampling the texture correctly using texture(u_texture, v_texCoords).

**Color Unpacking (If Applicable):**
If you're passing a packed color (as a single float) to the fragment shader, make sure you're unpacking
it correctly in the fragment shader. Ensure you are using uint for bitwise operations in the shader.

**Uniform Setting:**
Verify that you are setting the u_texture uniform to the correct texture unit (usually 0).
Use shader.SetUniform1i("u_texture", 0);.

3.Texture Binding and Activation:
---------------------------------

**Texture Unit Activation:**
Before binding your texture, you must activate the correct texture unit using
GL.ActiveTexture(TextureUnit.Texture0); (or TextureUnit.Texture1, etc., if using multiple textures).

**Texture Binding:**
Bind the texture using texture.Bind(); after activating the texture unit.

4.Matrices and Transformations:
-------------------------------

**Projection Matrix:**
Ensure your projection matrix is set up correctly (e.g., using Matrix4.CreateOrthographicOffCenter for
2D rendering).

**View and Model Matrices:**
If you're using view or model matrices, make sure they're set up correctly and that you're multiplying
them in the correct order in your vertex shader (gl_Position = projection * view * model * vertexPosition;).

**Combined Matrix:**
Combine your projection and transform matrices into a single matrix and pass that to the shader.

5.Rendering State:
------------------

**Blending:**
If you're using transparent textures, ensure blending is enabled: GL.Enable(EnableCap.Blend); and that the
blending function is set correctly: GL.BlendFunc(BlendingFactor.SrcAlpha, BlendingFactor.OneMinusSrcAlpha);.

**Depth Testing:**
If you're doing 3D rendering or need depth sorting, make sure depth testing is enabled:
GL.Enable(EnableCap.DepthTest);.

6.Vertex Buffer Object (VBO) and Element Buffer Object (EBO):
--------------------------------------------------------------

**VBO Creation and Binding:**
Ensure the VBO is created and bound correctly before setting up vertex attributes and before drawing.

**Data Upload:**
Ensure the vertex data is uploaded to the VBO using GL.BufferData.

**EBO Creation and Binding (If using indices):**
If using indexed drawing, ensure the EBO is created, bound, and the index data is uploaded.

**Debugging Steps:**
--------------------

**Simplify:**
Create a minimal test case with a single quad and a simple texture. This helps isolate the problem.

**Check OpenGL Errors:**
Use GL.GetError() after every OpenGL call to check for errors. This can often pinpoint the exact line
of code causing the problem.

**Debugging Tools:**
Use OpenGL debugging tools like RenderDoc or apitrace to inspect the rendering state and see what's
happening on the GPU.
