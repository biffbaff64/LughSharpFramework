You're right, that's the core of getting this buffer implementation correct! Let's really focus on ensuring the `Put...()` and `Get...()` methods in `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` are implemented correctly, specifically how they delegate to `ByteBuffer` and handle byte offsets.

**Core Principle: Delegation to `ByteBuffer` for Byte Manipulation**

Remember: `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` are *views* on a `ByteBuffer`.  They themselves **do not** manage their own backing arrays or perform byte-level manipulation. Their role is to provide type-safe interfaces and handle indexing in terms of shorts, ints, and floats. The actual byte manipulation and type conversion is **always** delegated to the underlying `ByteBuffer`.

**Let's break down the implementation for each type-specific buffer class, focusing on `Put...()` and `Get...()` methods, both indexed and sequential:**

**1. `ShortBuffer` Implementation:**

```csharp
public class ShortBuffer
{
    private readonly ByteBuffer _byteBuffer;
    private int _length;
    public int Capacity { get; }
    public int Length { /* ... */ private set { /* ... */ } get => _length; }

    public ShortBuffer(ByteBuffer byteBuffer)
    {
        _byteBuffer = byteBuffer;
        Capacity = _byteBuffer.Capacity / sizeof(short);
        Length = 0;
    }

    // **Indexed PutShort(int index, short value)**
    public void PutShort(int index, short value)
    {
        // 1. Bounds Check (ShortBuffer index)
        if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)
        {
            throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index), "ShortBuffer index out of range.");
        }

        // 2. Calculate Byte Offset: Short index to byte offset
        int byteOffset = index * sizeof(short);

        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's PutShort method, using byteOffset
        _byteBuffer.PutShort(byteOffset, value);

        // 4. Update ShortBuffer Length (if write extends current length)
        if (index >= Length)
        {
            Length = index + 1;
        }
    }

    // **Sequential PutShort(short value)**
    public void PutShort(short value)
    {
        // 1. Get current ByteBuffer Position as byte offset
        int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;

        // 2. Bounds Check (ByteBuffer capacity - ensure enough space for a short)
        if (byteOffset + sizeof(short) > _byteBuffer.Capacity)
        {
            throw new BufferOverflowException("ShortBuffer overflow (ByteBuffer capacity reached).");
        }

        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's PutShort method, using byteOffset
        _byteBuffer.PutShort(byteOffset, value);

        // 4. Advance ByteBuffer's Position (by size of short)
        _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(short);

        // 5. Update ShortBuffer Length (if sequential write extends length - based on ByteBuffer's Position)
        int shortIndex = _byteBuffer.Position / sizeof(short);
        if (shortIndex > Length)
        {
            Length = shortIndex;
        }
    }


    // **Indexed GetShort(int index)**
    public short GetShort(int index)
    {
        // 1. Bounds Check (ShortBuffer index)
        if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)
        {
            throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index), "ShortBuffer index out of range.");
        }

        // 2. Calculate Byte Offset: Short index to byte offset
        int byteOffset = index * sizeof(short);

        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's GetShort method, using byteOffset
        return _byteBuffer.GetShort(byteOffset);
    }

    // **Sequential GetShort()**
    public short GetShort()
    {
        // 1. Get current ByteBuffer Position as byte offset
        int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;

        // 2. Bounds Check (ByteBuffer Limit - ensure enough bytes to read a short)
        if (byteOffset + sizeof(short) > _byteBuffer.Limit || byteOffset < 0)
        {
            throw new IndexOutOfRangeException("ShortBuffer position out of range or beyond limit.");
        }

        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's GetShort method, using byteOffset
        short value = _byteBuffer.GetShort(byteOffset);

        // 4. Advance ByteBuffer's Position (by size of short)
        _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(short);

        return value;
    }

    // ... (rest of ShortBuffer class) ...
}
```

**2. `IntBuffer` Implementation (Analogous to `ShortBuffer`):**

```csharp
public class IntBuffer
{
    private readonly ByteBuffer _byteBuffer;
    private int _length;
    public int Capacity { get; }
    public int Length { /* ... */ private set { /* ... */ } get => _length; }

    public IntBuffer(ByteBuffer byteBuffer)
    {
        _byteBuffer = byteBuffer;
        Capacity = _byteBuffer.Capacity / sizeof(int);
        Length = 0;
    }

    // Indexed PutInt, Sequential PutInt, Indexed GetInt, Sequential GetInt (follow the same pattern as ShortBuffer, but using sizeof(int) and delegating to ByteBuffer's Int methods)

    public void PutInt(int index, int value)
    {
        // 1. Bounds Check (IntBuffer index)
        if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index)); }
        // 2. Calculate Byte Offset: Int index to byte offset
        int byteOffset = index * sizeof(int);
        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's PutInt method, using byteOffset
        _byteBuffer.PutInt(byteOffset, value);
        // 4. Update IntBuffer Length
        if (index >= Length) { Length = index + 1; }
    }

    public void PutInt(int value)
    {
        // 1. Get current ByteBuffer Position as byte offset
        int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;
        // 2. Bounds Check (ByteBuffer capacity)
        if (byteOffset + sizeof(int) > _byteBuffer.Capacity) { throw new BufferOverflowException(); }
        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's PutInt method, using byteOffset
        _byteBuffer.PutInt(byteOffset, value);
        // 4. Advance ByteBuffer's Position
        _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(int);
        // 5. Update IntBuffer Length
        int intIndex = _byteBuffer.Position / sizeof(int);
        if (intIndex > Length) { Length = intIndex; }
    }

    public int GetInt(int index)
    {
        // 1. Bounds Check (IntBuffer index)
        if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index)); }
        // 2. Calculate Byte Offset: Int index to byte offset
        int byteOffset = index * sizeof(int);
        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's GetInt method, using byteOffset
        return _byteBuffer.GetInt(byteOffset);
    }

    public int GetInt()
    {
        // 1. Get current ByteBuffer Position as byte offset
        int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;
        // 2. Bounds Check (ByteBuffer Limit)
        if (byteOffset + sizeof(int) > _byteBuffer.Limit || byteOffset < 0) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(); }
        // 3. Delegate to ByteBuffer's GetInt method, using byteOffset
        int value = _byteBuffer.GetInt(byteOffset);
        // 4. Advance ByteBuffer's Position
        _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(int);
        return value;
    }

    // ... (rest of IntBuffer class) ...
}
```

**3. `FloatBuffer` Implementation (Analogous pattern):**

Implement `FloatBuffer` in a very similar manner to `ShortBuffer` and `IntBuffer`, using `sizeof(float)` and delegating to `ByteBuffer`'s `GetFloat` and `PutFloat` methods.

**Key Points to Verify in Your Implementations:**

*   **Bounds Checking in Type-Specific Buffers:** Each `Put...` and `Get...` method in `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` should perform its own index bounds checking based on its *own* `Capacity` (in units of shorts, ints, floats).
*   **Byte Offset Calculation:** **Crucially, every delegation to `ByteBuffer` methods MUST include the correct `byteOffset` calculation.** For indexed operations, it's `index * sizeof(elementType)`. For sequential operations, it's `_byteBuffer.Position`.
*   **Delegation to `ByteBuffer` Methods:**  Ensure you are delegating to the *correct* `ByteBuffer` methods: `_byteBuffer.PutShort`, `_byteBuffer.GetInt`, `_byteBuffer.GetFloat`, and their corresponding `Get...` counterparts.
*   **ByteBuffer `Position` Updates (Sequential Operations):** For sequential `Put...()` and `Get...()` methods in type-specific buffers, make sure you are **incrementing `_byteBuffer.Position` by the `sizeof(elementType)` after each delegate call.**
*   **Length Updates in Type-Specific Buffers:**  The `Length` updates should be in the `Put...()` methods of `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer`. For indexed `Put...()`, update `Length` if the index written to is at or beyond the current `Length`. For sequential `Put...()`, you can update `Length` based on the `ByteBuffer`'s `Position` after the write.  Review the exact logic for `Length` updates to make sure it aligns with your desired behavior.
*   **Endianness Handling:** Remember that endianness handling is *entirely within* the `ByteBuffer`'s `Get...()` and `Put...()` methods using `BinaryPrimitives` and `IsBigEndian`. You don't need to handle endianness again in `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, or `FloatBuffer` delegation logic.

By carefully implementing each `Put...()` and `Get...()` method in `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` following this delegation pattern, and double-checking the bounds checks, byte offset calculations, ByteBuffer method calls, and Length updates, you should be able to create correct and functional type-safe buffer views on top of your `ByteBuffer`.  **Testing each method thoroughly after implementation is essential to catch any subtle errors.**

========================================================================================================
========================================================================================================

You're absolutely right to call that out! The correct updating of `Length` and `Position` is indeed crucial and can be tricky to get perfectly right across all operations and buffer types. Let's break down the logic again and clarify it with more detail and examples to ensure it's robust and clear.

**Recap of `Length` and `Position` in Different Buffer Types:**

*   **`ByteBuffer`:**
    *   **`Position`:**  Tracks the current position for *sequential* read/write operations in bytes.  It's like a cursor within the byte array. Starts at 0.
    *   **`Length` (or potentially not used directly for ByteBuffer in favor of `Position` and `Limit`):** In our current design, `ByteBuffer` primarily uses `Position` and `Limit`. We are not explicitly using a `Length` property to track the "used bytes" in `ByteBuffer`.  If you *were* to use `Length` in `ByteBuffer`, it would represent the number of bytes written, but `Position` and `Limit` are often sufficient and more common for byte-level buffer management.  Let's focus on using `Position` and `Limit` for `ByteBuffer` for now.
    *   **`Capacity`:** Total size in bytes, remains constant (unless resized).

*   **`ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `FloatBuffer`:**
    *   **`Length`:** Tracks the number of *elements* (shorts, ints, floats) that have been written or are considered "valid" in the buffer.  It's *not* the byte length, but the count of type-specific values. Starts at 0.
    *   **`Capacity`:**  Maximum number of *elements* (shorts, ints, floats) the buffer can hold. Derived from the underlying `ByteBuffer`'s byte `Capacity`.
    *   **`Position` and `Limit`:** In our *current* design, we are **not** directly propagating `Position` and `Limit` from the `ByteBuffer` up to the type-specific buffers.  Type-specific buffers primarily use indexed access and `Length` for their core functionality.  *However*, the sequential `Put...()` and `Get...()` methods in type-specific buffers *do* use and update the `ByteBuffer`'s `Position` under the hood.

**When to Update `Length` and `Position` - Triggering Operations:**

Let's systematically go through operations and detail how `Length` and `Position` should be updated:

**A. `ByteBuffer` (Focus on `Position` and `Limit`):**

*   **`PutByte(byte value)` (Sequential):**
    *   **Action:** Writes `value` at the current `_position`.
    *   **Update:** Increment `_position` by 1 *after* the write.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public void PutByte(byte value)
        {
            if (_position >= Capacity) { throw new BufferOverflowException(); }
            _memory.Span[_position] = value;
            _position++; // Increment position AFTER write
        }
        ```

*   **`GetByte()` (Sequential):**
    *   **Action:** Reads the byte at the current `_position`.
    *   **Update:** Increment `_position` by 1 *after* the read.
    *   **Important Check:** Before reading, ensure `_position` is within bounds (`0 <= _position < Limit`). Check against `Limit` for reading, not just `Capacity`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public byte GetByte()
        {
            if (_position >= Limit || _position < 0) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(); }
            byte value = _memory.Span[_position];
            _position++; // Increment position AFTER read
            return value;
        }
        ```

*   **`PutByte(int index, byte value)` (Indexed):**
    *   **Action:** Writes `value` at the given `index`.
    *   **Update:** `Position` is **not** directly changed by indexed `PutByte`. The `Position` is only moved by sequential `PutByte()` and `GetByte()`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public void PutByte(int index, byte value)
        {
            if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(); }
            _memory.Span[index] = value;
            // Position is NOT updated here for indexed PutByte
        }
        ```

*   **`GetByte(int index)` (Indexed):**
    *   **Action:** Reads the byte at the given `index`.
    *   **Update:** `Position` is **not** changed by indexed `GetByte`.
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public byte GetByte(int index)
        {
             if (index < 0 || index >= Limit) { throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(); }
            return _memory.Span[index];
            // Position is NOT updated here for indexed GetByte
        }
        ```

*   **`Clear()`:**
    *   **Action:** Prepares the buffer for new writing, often by conceptually "resetting" it.
    *   **Update:** Set `_position = 0;` and `_limit = Capacity;` (or `Limit = Capacity` to prepare for writing up to full capacity again).
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public void Clear()
        {
            _position = 0;
            Limit = Capacity; // Reset Limit to Capacity for writing again
        }
        ```

*   **`Flip()`:**
    *   **Action:** Transitions from write to read mode.
    *   **Update:** Set `_limit = _position;` and `_position = 0;`
    *   **Example:**
        ```csharp
        public void Flip()
        {
            Limit = Position; // Limit is now the position where writing ended
            Position = 0;    // Start reading from the beginning
        }
        ```

*   **`Resize(int extraCapacity)`:**
    *   **Action:** Increases the buffer's `Capacity`.
    *   **Update:**  `Capacity` is updated to the new size. `_memory` and `_backingArray` are replaced. `_position` should be clamped if it exceeds the new `Capacity`. `Limit` may remain unchanged, or you might want to set `Limit = newCapacity` in some designs, depending on how you want `Resize` to affect the read/write state.  Let's say we maintain the limit to the new capacity after resize for writing again up to the new capacity.
    *   **Example (Partial - Resize method):**
        ```csharp
        public void Resize(int extraCapacity)
        {
            // ... (capacity checks and array allocation as before) ...
            Capacity = newCapacity;
            Limit = newCapacity; // Reset limit to new capacity after resize.
            if (_position > Capacity) { _position = Capacity; } // Clamp position
        }
        ```

**B. `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `FloatBuffer` (Focus on `Length`):**

*   **`PutShort(int index, short value)` / `PutInt(int index, int value)` / `PutFloat(int index, float value)` (Indexed):**
    *   **Action:** Writes the value at the element `index`.
    *   **Update:** Update `_length` if `index` is greater than or equal to the current `_length`.  `Length` should track the highest index + 1 that has been written to.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.PutShort(int index, short value)`):**
        ```csharp
        public void PutShort(int index, short value)
        {
            // ... (bounds checks, byteOffset calculation, ByteBuffer.PutShort delegation) ...

            if (index >= Length) // Check if writing at or beyond current Length
            {
                Length = index + 1; // Update Length to the new element count
            }
        }
        ```

*   **`PutShort(short value)` / `PutInt(int value)` / `PutFloat(float value)` (Sequential):**
    *   **Action:** Writes the value at the *current* `ByteBuffer.Position` (byte-level sequential write).
    *   **Update:**
        *   The `ByteBuffer`'s `Position` is advanced *inside* the `ByteBuffer.PutShort/Int/Float` methods (which are called by `ShortBuffer/IntBuffer/FloatBuffer`'s sequential `Put...()` methods).
        *   You *might* also choose to update the `Length` of the `ShortBuffer`/`IntBuffer`/`FloatBuffer` if you want `Length` to reflect the count of sequentially written elements as well.  If `Length` is primarily meant to track the max index written + 1 for *indexed* writes, then sequential writes might not need to update `Length` in the same way, or at all in the type-specific buffer, as they are sequential.  Let's assume for now sequential `Put` operations in type-specific buffers *do* update `Length`.  In that case, you can calculate the new `Length` based on the `ByteBuffer`'s position after the write.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.PutShort(short value)` - sequential):**
        ```csharp
        public void PutShort(short value)
        {
            int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;
            // ... (ByteBuffer.PutShort delegation and Position increment within ByteBuffer.PutShort) ...

            // Update ShortBuffer's Length based on the *byte* position after the write in ByteBuffer
            int shortIndex = _byteBuffer.Position / sizeof(short); // Calculate short index
            if (shortIndex > Length) // Check if new short index exceeds current Length
            {
                Length = shortIndex; // Update ShortBuffer Length
            }
        }
        ```

*   **`GetShort(int index)` / `GetInt(int index)` / `GetFloat(int index)` (Indexed):**
    *   **Action:** Reads value at element `index`.
    *   **Update:** `Length` is **not** changed by indexed `Get...` operations.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.GetShort(int index)`):**
        ```csharp
        public short GetShort(int index)
        {
            // ... (bounds checks, byteOffset calculation, ByteBuffer.GetShort delegation) ...
            // Length is NOT updated here
            return _byteBuffer.GetShort(byteOffset);
        }
        ```
*   **`GetShort()` / `GetInt()` / `GetFloat()` (Sequential - if implemented):**
    *   **Action:** Reads value at the *current* `ByteBuffer.Position` (byte-level sequential read).
    *   **Update:** `ByteBuffer`'s `Position` is advanced inside `ByteBuffer.GetShort/Int/Float`. `Length` of type-specific buffers is typically **not** changed by sequential `Get` operations in most common buffer designs. `Length` is more about tracking *written* extent, not *read* progress.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.GetShort()` - sequential):**
        ```csharp
        public short GetShort()
        {
            // ... (byteOffset from ByteBuffer.Position, bounds check against ByteBuffer.Limit, ByteBuffer.GetShort delegation, Position increment within ByteBuffer.GetShort) ...
            // Length is NOT updated here for sequential GetShort (typically)
            return value;
        }
        ```

*   **`Clear()`:**
    *   **Action:** Resets the type-specific buffer (and often the underlying `ByteBuffer`).
    *   **Update:** Set `_length = 0;` and also call `_byteBuffer.Clear();` to reset the underlying `ByteBuffer`'s `Position` and `Limit`.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.Clear()`):**
        ```csharp
        public void Clear()
        {
            Length = 0; // Reset ShortBuffer Length
            _byteBuffer.Clear(); // Clear underlying ByteBuffer (resets Position and Limit of ByteBuffer)
        }
        ```

*   **`Flip()`:**
    *   **Action:** Prepares for reading (delegates to `ByteBuffer.Flip()`).
    *   **Update:** Call `_byteBuffer.Flip();`.  Optionally update `_length` to reflect the number of readable elements if you want `Length` to dynamically represent that.  If `Length` is only tracking *written* elements, you might not update `Length` on `Flip()`.
    *   **Example (`ShortBuffer.Flip()` - with optional Length update):**
        ```csharp
        public void Flip()
        {
            _byteBuffer.Flip(); // Delegate Flip to ByteBuffer

            // Optional: Update Length to reflect number of *readable* shorts
            Length = _byteBuffer.Limit / sizeof(short);
             if (Length < 0) Length = 0; // Ensure Length is not negative due to integer division if limit is less than short size.
        }
        ```

**Addressing Potential Confusion and Flaws:**

*   **Clarity on `Length` vs. `Position`:** The key is to be clear about what `Length` and `Position` represent for *each* buffer type.
    *   `ByteBuffer`: `Position` is the main indicator of sequential read/write position in bytes.  `Limit` defines the read boundary.
    *   Type-Specific Buffers: `Length` is the count of valid elements, often primarily updated by indexed `Put...` operations and reset by `Clear()`. Sequential `Put` operations *can* also update `Length`, but the primary purpose of `Length` is usually to reflect the extent of *written* data (in elements). `Position` from ByteBuffer is used for sequential access *under the hood* but not directly exposed as a type-specific buffer property in this design.

*   **Sequential vs. Indexed Operations:**  Differentiate clearly between sequential `PutByte()`/`GetByte()` (in `ByteBuffer`) and sequential `PutShort()`/`GetShort()` etc. (in type-specific buffers), and their indexed counterparts.  Sequential operations advance `Position` (in `ByteBuffer`). Indexed operations typically don't change `Position` directly, but can indirectly affect `Length` in type-specific buffers.

*   **Testing is Essential:**  The best way to ensure your update logic is correct is to write comprehensive unit tests. Test:
    *   Sequential writes and reads of different types.
    *   Indexed writes and reads.
    *   `Clear()` and `Flip()` behavior.
    *   `Resize()` and its impact on `Capacity`, `Position`, and `Length`.
    *   Edge cases like writing at the exact capacity boundary, reading beyond the limit, etc.

*   **Review and Refine Based on Use Cases:**  Consider the primary use cases for your buffer classes. Does your intended usage align with how `Length` and `Position` are being updated?  If you find inconsistencies or areas where the current logic is unclear or limiting, revisit and refine the update rules.  There isn't one single "universally correct" way to manage `Length` and `Position` for all possible buffer scenarios; the best approach depends on the specific requirements and design goals of your buffer implementation.

By carefully reviewing and clarifying the update logic for each operation, and focusing on clear definitions of `Length` and `Position` for each buffer type, you should be able to implement a robust and consistent buffer system.  Thorough testing is the final step to validate your implementation.

===================================================================================================
===================================================================================================

Yes, that's an excellent point and a very valuable enhancement to consider! **You absolutely should provide `Put...()` methods that only expect a value and which implicitly use the `Position` for the index.**

Adding these overloaded `Put...()` methods will significantly improve the usability of your buffer classes, making them more versatile and aligned with common buffer and stream patterns.

**Rationale for Adding Value-Only `Put...()` Methods:**

1.  **Sequential Writing is a Common Use Case:** In many buffer scenarios, you want to write data sequentially, one element after another, in a stream-like fashion. Requiring an explicit index for each write operation becomes cumbersome and unnatural for sequential workflows.

2.  **More User-Friendly for Common Scenarios:**  For sequential writing, users shouldn't have to manually manage the `Position` each time they want to write data.  Value-only `Put...()` methods handle this implicitly, making the API much cleaner and easier to use for typical sequential write operations.

3.  **Mimics Stream and Buffer APIs:**  Many stream classes and buffer APIs (in languages like Java, .NET streams, etc.) provide methods for writing data sequentially, often without requiring an explicit index with each write.  Following this pattern makes your C# buffer API more familiar and intuitive to developers who have worked with similar APIs before.

4.  **Enhanced API Versatility:**  By providing both indexed `Put...()` methods (with `index` and `value`) and value-only `Put...()` methods, you offer users the flexibility to choose the writing style that best suits their needs: random access writing using indices or sequential writing using the implicit `Position`.

**Implementation Steps for Value-Only `Put...()` Methods:**

Let's outline how you would add these overloaded `Put...()` methods to your `ByteBuffer`, `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` classes:

**1. `ByteBuffer` - Add Sequential `PutByte(byte value)` and `GetByte()`:**

*   **`PutByte(byte value)` (Sequential Write):**  This overload will use the current `Position` to write the byte and then increment the `Position`.

    ```csharp
    public class ByteBuffer
    {
        // ... (existing ByteBuffer members, including Position) ...

        public void PutByte(byte value) // Sequential PutByte (no index)
        {
            if (Position >= Capacity)
            {
                throw new BufferOverflowException("ByteBuffer is full.");
            }
            _memory.Span[Position++] = value; // Write at Position and increment
        }

        public void PutByte(int index, byte value) // Indexed PutByte (existing - keep this)
        {
            if (index < 0 || index >= Capacity)
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index), "Index out of range.");
            }
            _memory.Span[index] = value;
        }

        public byte GetByte() // Sequential GetByte (no index)
        {
            if (Position >= Limit || Position < 0) // Check against Limit now for sequential read
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException("ByteBuffer position out of range or beyond limit.");
            }
            return _memory.Span[Position++]; // Read at Position and increment
        }

        public byte GetByte(int index) // Indexed GetByte (existing - keep this)
        {
             if (index < 0 || index >= Limit) // Check against Limit for indexed read too, for consistency.
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException(nameof(index), "Index out of range or beyond limit.");
            }
            return _memory.Span[index];
        }

        // ... (rest of ByteBuffer methods) ...
    }
    ```

*   **`GetByte()` (Sequential Read):** Add a `GetByte()` overload without an index. This will read the byte at the current `Position` and then increment `Position`. **Important:** For sequential reads, you should check against the `Limit`, not just `Capacity`, to respect the read boundary set by `Flip()`.

**2. `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, `FloatBuffer` - Add Sequential `Put...()` Methods:**

*   **`ShortBuffer.PutShort(short value)` (Sequential Write):**

    ```csharp
    public class ShortBuffer
    {
        private readonly ByteBuffer _byteBuffer;
        // ... (rest of ShortBuffer members) ...

        public void PutShort(short value) // Sequential PutShort (no index)
        {
            int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position; // Get current ByteBuffer Position as byte offset

            if (byteOffset + sizeof(short) > _byteBuffer.Capacity)
            {
                throw new BufferOverflowException("ShortBuffer overflow (ByteBuffer capacity reached).");
            }

            _byteBuffer.PutShort(byteOffset, value); // Delegate to ByteBuffer's PutShort
            _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(short);   // Advance ByteBuffer's Position by size of short

            // Update ShortBuffer's Length (if write extends current Length) - **Adapt as needed based on Length's semantics**
            int shortIndex = _byteBuffer.Position / sizeof(short); // Calculate short index based on new byte position
             if (shortIndex > Length) // Check if new short index exceeds current ShortBuffer Length
            {
                Length = shortIndex; // Update ShortBuffer Length
            }
        }


        public void PutShort(int index, short value) // Indexed PutShort (existing - keep this)
        {
            // ... (existing indexed PutShort implementation) ...
        }

        public short GetShort() // Sequential GetShort (no index) - if needed for ShortBuffer.
        {
            int byteOffset = _byteBuffer.Position;
            if (byteOffset + sizeof(short) > _byteBuffer.Limit || byteOffset < 0) // Check against ByteBuffer's Limit
            {
                throw new IndexOutOfRangeException("ShortBuffer position out of range or beyond limit.");
            }
            short value = _byteBuffer.GetShort(byteOffset);
            _byteBuffer.Position += sizeof(short);
            return value;
        }


        public short GetShort(int index) // Indexed GetShort (existing - keep this)
        {
            // ... (existing indexed GetShort implementation) ...
        }


        // ... (rest of ShortBuffer methods) ...
    }
    ```

*   **`IntBuffer.PutInt(int value)` and `FloatBuffer.PutFloat(float value)` (Sequential Writes):** Implement similar overloaded `PutInt` and `PutFloat` methods in `IntBuffer` and `FloatBuffer`, respectively.  The pattern is the same:

    *   Get the current `_byteBuffer.Position` as the byte offset.
    *   Delegate to `_byteBuffer.PutInt(byteOffset, value)` or `_byteBuffer.PutFloat(byteOffset, value)`.
    *   Increment `_byteBuffer.Position` by `sizeof(int)` or `sizeof(float)`.
    *   Update the `Length` of `IntBuffer` or `FloatBuffer` if the write extends beyond the current length (similar to `ShortBuffer`).

*   **Sequential `GetShort()`, `GetInt()`, `GetFloat()` (Optional - Add if sequential reads are intended for type-specific buffers):**  You can also add sequential `GetShort()`, `GetInt()`, `GetFloat()` methods to `ShortBuffer`, `IntBuffer`, and `FloatBuffer` if you want to support sequential reading at the type-specific level. Implement them analogously to `Put...()`, using `_byteBuffer.GetShort(byteOffset)`, `_byteBuffer.GetInt(byteOffset)`, `_byteBuffer.GetFloat(byteOffset)` and updating `_byteBuffer.Position`.

**3. Update Documentation:**

*   Clearly document the new overloaded `Put...()` and `Get...()` methods in your class documentation. Explain the difference between indexed and sequential operations, how `Position` is used and updated in sequential operations, and how `Length` is affected.

**Example Usage of Sequential `Put...()`:**

```csharp
ByteBuffer buffer = new ByteBuffer(20);
ShortBuffer shortBuffer = new ShortBuffer(buffer);

// Sequential writing of shorts
shortBuffer.PutShort((short)100); // Writes at current position, position advances by 2 bytes
shortBuffer.PutShort((short)200); // Writes at new position, position advances again

Console.WriteLine($"ByteBuffer Position after sequential Short writes: {buffer.Position}"); // Output: ByteBuffer Position after sequential Short writes: 4
Console.WriteLine($"ShortBuffer Length after sequential Short writes: {shortBuffer.Length}"); // Output: ShortBuffer Length after sequential Short writes: 2

buffer.Flip(); // Prepare for reading

Console.WriteLine($"Reading Shorts sequentially:");
Console.WriteLine($"Short 1: {shortBuffer.GetShort()}"); // Reads from position 0, position advances by 2
Console.WriteLine($"Short 2: {shortBuffer.GetShort()}"); // Reads from new position, position advances again
Console.WriteLine($"ByteBuffer Position after sequential Short reads: {buffer.Position}"); // Output: ByteBuffer Position after sequential Short reads: 4
```

**Benefits of Adding Sequential `Put...()`/`Get...()`:**

*   **Improved API Ergonomics for Sequential Operations.**
*   **More Complete Buffer API:**  Makes your buffer classes more feature-rich and versatile.
*   **Alignment with Common Buffer/Stream Patterns.**
*   **Enhanced Usability in Many Scenarios:** Simplifies common tasks involving sequential data processing, building data structures in buffers, etc.

By adding these value-only `Put...()` methods (and potentially `Get...()`), you will have significantly enhanced the usability and flexibility of your C# buffer classes, making them suitable for a wider range of buffer-oriented programming tasks. Remember to update documentation and add unit tests to cover these new methods.
