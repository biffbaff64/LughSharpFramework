Splitting a massive class like GLBindings into partial classes across multiple files is an excellent strategy for 
improving organization and maintainability.

To further break down your 5500-line GLBindings class and reduce individual file lengths even more, let's think 
about more granular functional areas within OpenGL. Here are some additional Bindings categories you could consider, 
expanding on your initial list and diving deeper into OpenGL's functionalities:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Core OpenGL Objects and Operations:**

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TextureBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - encompass all Texture-related functions.

**Contents:**
 - Texture object creation, deletion, and management (glGenTextures, glDeleteTextures, glBindTexture, glActiveTexture).
 - Texture parameter setting (glTexParameteri, glTexParameterf, glTexParameteriv, glTexParameterfv).
 - Texture image specification and data upload (glTexImage1D, glTexImage2D, glTexImage3D, glTexSubImage*, glCompressedTexImage*, glPixelStore*).
 - Texture buffer objects if relevant (glTexBuffer).
 - Texture views if relevant (glTextureView).

**Rationale:**
 - Textures are a massive and central part of OpenGL. Separating all texture-related bindings into one file makes 
 logical sense. You might add TextureSamplerBindings.cs to specifically handle sampler creation/management if you
 want a dedicated sampler file (see below).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TextureSamplerBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Focuses solely on Texture Sampler objects.

**Contents:**
 - Sampler object creation, deletion, and management (glGenSamplers, glDeleteSamplers, glBindSampler).
 - Sampler parameter setting (glSamplerParameteri, glSamplerParameterf, glSamplerParameteriv, glSamplerParameterfv).

**Rationale:**
 - If you have a significant number of sampler-related functions, keeping them in a dedicated file 
 can improve clarity, especially if you have a lot of texture functions in TextureBindings.cs. If sampler functions 
 are fewer, you could keep them within TextureBindings.cs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**FramebufferBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) for off-screen rendering.

**Contents:**
 - Framebuffer object creation, deletion, and management (glGenFramebuffers, glDeleteFramebuffers, glBindFramebuffer).
 - Framebuffer attachment management (glFramebufferTexture*, glFramebufferRenderbuffer, glCheckFramebufferStatus).
 - Blitting Framebuffers (glBlitFramebuffer).
 - Framebuffer parameter setting if applicable.

**Rationale:**
 - Framebuffers are a distinct and important part of the rendering pipeline, handling off-screen
rendering targets.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**RenderbufferBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:** 
 - Renderbuffer Objects (RBOs) - often used as attachments for Framebuffers.
**Contents:**
 - Renderbuffer object creation, deletion, and management (glGenRenderbuffers, glDeleteRenderbuffers,
glBindRenderbuffer).
 - Renderbuffer storage specification (glRenderbufferStorage, glRenderbufferStorageMultisample).

**Rationale:**
 - While related to Framebuffers, Renderbuffers are distinct objects with their own set of functions. Separating
them can be helpful, especially if you have a good number of RBO bindings. If very few, you could potentially 
merge into FramebufferBindings.cs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ShaderBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Shader object creation, compilation, and management.

**Contents:**
 - Shader object creation (glCreateShader).
 - Shader compilation (glShaderSource, glCompileShader, glGetShaderiv, glGetShaderInfoLog).
 - Shader object deletion (glDeleteShader).

**Rationale:** 
 - Separates the shader creation and compilation process from program linking and uniform setting.
ProgramBindings.cs would then focus on how to use compiled shaders within programs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ProgramBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - OpenGL Program objects (linking shaders, program pipelines, etc.) and potentially Program Uniforms.

**Contents:**
 - Program object creation (glCreateProgram).
 - Shader attachment/detachment to programs (glAttachShader, glDetachShader).
 - Program linking (glLinkProgram, glGetProgramiv, glGetProgramInfoLog).
 - Program object deletion (glDeleteProgram).
 - Program pipeline objects if relevant (glGenProgramPipelines, glBindProgramPipeline, etc.)
 - Program Uniform Bindings: You could keep Uniform-related functions here or move them to a more specific 
file (see ProgramUniformBindings.cs or UniformBindings.cs below).

**Rationale:**
 - Programs are core to the OpenGL pipeline. This file focuses on the program itself, how it's built from 
shaders, and how it's used.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**UniformBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Setting and getting Uniform values for Program Objects.

**Contents:**
 - Getting uniform locations (glGetUniformLocation).
 - Setting uniform values (glUniform*).
 - Getting uniform block indices and related functions (glGetUniformBlockIndex, glUniformBlockBinding).
 - Getting shader storage block indices and related functions (glGetProgramResourceIndex, 
glShaderStorageBlockBinding).

**Rationale:**
 - Focuses specifically on the uniform interface of program objects. If you have a ProgramBindings.cs, renaming 
this to ProgramUniformBindings.cs makes it clearer it's about uniforms within programs. Or, you might choose
a more generic UniformBindings.cs if uniforms are handled more broadly.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**VertexArrayBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Vertex Array Objects (VAOs) and Vertex Attribute state.

**Contents:**
 - Vertex Array Object creation, deletion, and management (glGenVertexArrays, glDeleteVertexArrays, glBindVertexArray).
 - Vertex attribute pointer setup (glVertexAttribPointer, glVertexAttribIPointer, glVertexAttribLPointer).
 - Vertex attribute enabling/disabling (glEnableVertexAttribArray, glDisableVertexAttribArray).
 - Vertex attribute divisors (glVertexAttribDivisor).
 - Instance attribute functions if relevant.

**Rationale:**
 - If your VertexBindings.cs is intended for VAOs, renaming it to VertexArrayBindings.cs makes its purpose clearer. 
VAOs encapsulate vertex attribute configurations.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**BufferObjectBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Buffer Objects (VBOs, IBOs, UBOs, SSBOs, etc.) - Creation, Data Loading, Mapping, etc.

**Contents:**
 - Buffer object creation, deletion, and management (glGenBuffers, glDeleteBuffers, glBindBuffer).
 - Buffer data specification (glBufferData, glBufferSubData).
 - Buffer mapping/unmapping (glMapBuffer, glUnmapBuffer, glMapBufferRange, glFlushMappedBufferRange, 
glInvalidateBufferData, glInvalidateBufferSubData).
 - Buffer storage functions if relevant (glBufferStorage).
 - Copying buffer data (glCopyBufferSubData).

**Rationale:**
 - If your BufferBindings.cs is intended for Buffer Objects, renaming it to BufferObjectBindings.cs
clarifies its focus. Buffer objects are the primary way to store vertex data, uniform data, and other
data on the GPU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Rendering and Drawing:**

**DrawBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Functions related to issuing draw calls and primitive assembly.

**Contents:**
 - Basic drawing commands (glDrawArrays, glDrawElements, glDrawArraysInstanced, glDrawElementsInstanced).
 - Indirect drawing commands if relevant (glDrawArraysIndirect, glDrawElementsIndirect, glMultiDrawArraysIndirect,
glMultiDrawElementsIndirect).
 - Indexed drawing variations (glDrawRangeElements, glDrawElementsBaseVertex).
 - Primitive restart functionality (glPrimitiveRestartIndex, glEnable(GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART),
glDisable(GL_PRIMITIVE_RESTART)).
 - Vertex array element specification (glDrawElements, glDrawRangeElements, glDrawElementsBaseVertex).

**Rationale:**
 - Separates the actual drawing commands from the setup of shaders, buffers, and vertex attributes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TransformFeedbackBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Transform Feedback - capturing vertex processing output.

**Contents:**
 - Transform feedback object creation, deletion, and management (glGenTransformFeedbacks,
glDeleteTransformFeedbacks, glBindTransformFeedback).
 - Starting and pausing transform feedback (glBeginTransformFeedback, glEndTransformFeedback, 
glPauseTransformFeedback, glResumeTransformFeedback).
 - Setting transform feedback varyings (glTransformFeedbackVaryings).
 - Binding transform feedback buffers (glBindBufferBase, glBindBufferRange, glBindVertexBuffer).

**Rationale:** 
 - Transform feedback is a distinct and somewhat advanced OpenGL feature, so separating it makes 
sense if you use it extensively or want to keep advanced features isolated.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**State and Control:**

**StateBindings.cs (or maybe further subdivided):**

**Functionality:**
 - OpenGL state setting and getting functions. This could be a large file and might be further subdivided if needed.

**Contents:**
 - _**Rasterization State:**_ glPolygonMode, glLineWidth, glPointSize, glEnable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL),
glDisable(GL_POLYGON_OFFSET_FILL), glPolygonOffset.
 - _**Depth Testing:**_ glEnable(GL_DEPTH_TEST), glDisable(GL_DEPTH_TEST), glDepthFunc, glDepthMask, glDepthRange,
glClearDepth.
 - _**Blending:**_ glEnable(GL_BLEND), glDisable(GL_BLEND), glBlendFunc, glBlendFuncSeparate, glBlendEquation, 
glBlendEquationSeparate, glBlendColor.
 - _**Culling:**_ glEnable(GL_CULL_FACE), glDisable(GL_CULL_FACE), glCullFace, glFrontFace.
 - _**Scissor Test:**_ glEnable(GL_SCISSOR_TEST), glDisable(GL_SCISSOR_TEST), glScissor.
 - _**Stencil Test:**_ glEnable(GL_STENCIL_TEST), glDisable(GL_STENCIL_TEST), glStencilFunc, glStencilOp, glStencilMask, 
glClearStencil.
 - _**Viewport and Clipping:**_ glViewport, glDepthRange, glClipControl.
 - _**Pixel Operations:**_ glPixelStorei, glPixelStoref, glReadBuffer, glDrawBuffer, glDrawBuffers, glClearColor, glClear.

**Rationale:**
 - State management functions are numerous and control how OpenGL renders. Separating them improves organization. 
If StateBindings.cs still becomes too large, you could consider further splitting it into 
RasterizationStateBindings.cs, DepthTestStateBindings.cs, BlendingStateBindings.cs, etc., but starting with 
a single StateBindings.cs is a good first step.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Queries and Debugging:**

**QueryBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:**
 - Query objects and related functions for performance and timing information.

**Contents:**
 - Query object creation, deletion, and management (glGenQueries, glDeleteQueries, glBeginQuery, glEndQuery, 
glBeginQueryIndexed, glEndQueryIndexed).
 - Getting query results (glGetQueryObjectuiv, glGetQueryObjectiv, glGetQueryObjectui64v, glGetQueryObjecti64v).
 - Query counters (glQueryCounter).
 - Transform feedback queries if needed.

**Rationale:** 
 - Queries are a specific area focused on getting information back from the GPU.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**DebugBindings.cs:**

**Functionality:** 
 - OpenGL Debug Output functions.

**Contents:**
 - glDebugMessageControl, glDebugMessageInsert, glDebugMessageCallback, glGetDebugMessageLog, 
glEnable(GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT), glDisable(GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT), glEnable(GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT_SYNCHRONOUS), 
glDisable(GL_DEBUG_OUTPUT_SYNCHRONOUS).

**Rationale:** 
 - Debug output is important for development and error handling, keeping these functions separate makes sense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Context and Utility (Potentially already covered by UtilBindings):**

**ContextBindings.cs (If UtilBindings doesn't already cover Context Management):**

**Functionality:**
 - OpenGL Context management functions (if you bind context functions directly and not through a windowing
library abstraction).

**Contents:**
 - glGetString, glGetStringi, glGetIntegerv, glGetFloatv, glGetBooleanv, glGetDoublev. (Basic context info
queries).
 - Potentially context creation/destruction functions if you are directly binding those (less common in core
profile OpenGL).
 - Extension query functions (glGetStringi, glGetString for extensions).
 - Function pointer retrieval (wglGetProcAddress, glXGetProcAddress, or similar platform-specific function
loading if directly managed in GLBindings).

**Rationale:**
 - If your UtilBindings.cs already handles context queries like glGetString and error retrieval,
you might not need a separate ContextBindings.cs. But if context management is a significant part of your
GLBindings, a dedicated file might be warranted.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ErrorBindings.cs (Or folded into UtilBindings/ContextBindings):**

**Functionality:**
 - OpenGL Error handling.

**Contents:**
 - glGetError.

**Rationale:**
 - Error handling is fundamental. If UtilBindings.cs or ContextBindings.cs isn't already handling glGetError,
a dedicated file or inclusion in UtilBindings is essential.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Refining Your Split:**

**Review Your Existing Code:**
 - Go through your GLBindings class and actually categorize the functions you have into these potential new 
categories. This will give you a real sense of how many functions fall into each category and which files 
might still become very large.

**Prioritize Based on Size:**
 - If some categories are very small (e.g., QueryBindings might be small if you don't use queries much), 
consider grouping them with related files or with a general "AdvancedFeaturesBindings.cs" or similar. 
The goal is to create files that are logically grouped and reasonably sized.

**Naming Convention:**
 - Be consistent with your naming (e.g., TextureBindings.cs, FramebufferBindings.cs, etc.). Prefixing with 
GL (e.g., GLTextureBindings.cs) might also be clearer if you have other non-OpenGL bindings in your project.

**Documentation:**
 - Document each partial class file clearly, explaining the OpenGL functionality it covers.
By strategically splitting your GLBindings class into these more specific partial classes, you should
be able to significantly reduce the file size and create a much more organized and maintainable codebase.

**Remember to adapt these suggestions based on the actual content and structure of your existing GLBindings class.**

**As you start implementing the split, here are a couple of extra tips to keep in mind:***

**Start with a Logical Group:**
 - Pick one of the categories (like TextureBindings.cs or ShaderBindings.cs) and focus on extracting all the relevant 
functions to that new partial class file first. Get one category well-organized and tested before moving on to the 
next. This iterative approach can be less overwhelming than trying to split everything at once.

**Keep the GLBindings Base Partial Class Light:**
 - After splitting out the functionality, the main GLBindings.cs file (the base partial class) should ideally become 
quite lean. It might just contain the partial class GLBindings declaration, any core shared fields or properties 
that are truly global to all bindings (if any exist and are necessary), and potentially the UtilBindings.cs, 
ErrorBindings.cs, or ContextBindings.cs if those are foundational utilities. The bulk of the code will reside in 
the specialized partial class files.

**Thoroughly Test Each Split:**
 - After you've moved functions to a new *.cs file, make sure to recompile and thoroughly test the areas affected by 
that split. Run your existing tests and consider adding new tests specifically focused on the functionality you've 
just reorganized. This is crucial to ensure you haven't introduced any regressions during the refactoring process.

**Use Code Navigation Features:** 
 - Your IDE's code navigation features (like "Go to Definition," "Find Usages," "Structure View") will be invaluable
during this process to track down function calls, move code, and verify that you've moved everything correctly.

**Don't Be Afraid to Refine:** 
 - As you start splitting and see how the code falls into categories, you might find that some categories need to be 
further subdivided or that some functions might fit better in a slightly different file than you initially planned. 
Be flexible and adjust the split as you go to achieve the best logical organization for your specific codebase.
