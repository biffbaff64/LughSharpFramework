Phase 1: Understanding the Current Table-Driven Logic (High-Level)
------------------------------------------------------------------

Identify the States: Even without fully understanding the table contents, try to infer the different states
your parser currently operates in.
Look at the constants (like JSON_START) and any other numerical values used as states. What aspects of JSON
parsing do these likely correspond to (e.g., parsing an object key, parsing an array element, parsing a string, etc.)?

Trace Key Transitions: Pick a few simple JSON examples (e.g., {}, ["a"], {"key": 1}) and try to manually
trace how the currentState changes based on the input characters and the FindTransition logic. Even if you
don't understand why a specific transition happens, try to map the input character and current state to the next state.

Identify Actions: Look at the ExecuteActions method and the _jsonActions table. What kinds of actions are being
performed? These actions will need to be reimplemented in your new structure.

Phase 2: Designing the New Code-Based State Machine
---------------------------------------------------

Define States as an Enum: Create a clear enum to represent the different states of your JSON parser 
(e.g., Start, ObjectStart, ObjectKey, ValueStart, String, Number, ArrayStart, ArrayElement, End). 
Choose descriptive names that reflect the parsing context.

Create a State Transition Function (or Table):

Function-Based: You could have a function that takes the currentState and the current input character and
returns the nextState. This function would contain switch statements or if-else blocks to define the transitions 
based on the JSON grammar.

Code-Based Table (Simpler): You could create a simpler, more explicit table in code 
(e.g., a Dictionary<State, Dictionary<char, State>> or a similar structure) that directly maps current 
states and input characters to next states. This would be more readable than the current table structure.

Implement Action Handling: Instead of the _jsonActions table, you would directly embed the actions within 
your state transition logic. For example, when transitioning to the ObjectKey state after encountering an 
opening brace, you would have code that sets the _stringIsName flag.

Phase 3: Refactoring ParseInternal and ProcessState
---------------------------------------------------

Update ParseInternal: Modify the while loop to iterate through the input, and within the loop, call your
new state transition function to get the nextState.

Implement ProcessState (or Integrate into the Loop): The logic of ProcessState would be replaced by your
state transition function and the direct execution of actions based on the transitions.

Handle EOF: Explicitly handle the end of the input within your state machine logic. Define transitions
that occur when the end of the input is reached in a particular state.

Implement Error Handling: As you define your state transitions, explicitly handle invalid characters or
unexpected input for each state by setting the _parseException.

Phase 4: Testing and Iteration
------------------------------

Write Unit Tests: Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests covering various valid and invalid JSON inputs,
including edge cases.

Refactor Incrementally: Don't try to rewrite the entire parser at once. Focus on one part of the JSON 
grammar (e.g., parsing strings) and refactor that first, ensuring it passes your tests. 
Then move on to other parts.

Compare Behavior: For each refactored part, compare the behavior of your new code with the old table-driven 
logic (using the same inputs) to ensure correctness.

Example Snippet (Illustrative - Function-Based State Machine):

C#

private enum JsonParseState
{
    Start,
    ObjectStart,
    ObjectKeyStart,
    ObjectKey,
    Colon,
    ValueStart,
    String,
    Number,
    // ... other states ...
}

private JsonParseState GetNextState(JsonParseState currentState, char inputChar)
{
    switch (currentState)
    {
        case JsonParseState.Start:
            if (inputChar == '{') return JsonParseState.ObjectStart;
            if (inputChar == '[') return JsonParseState.ArrayStart;
            if (inputChar == '"') return JsonParseState.String;
            // ... other start characters ...
            break;
        case JsonParseState.ObjectStart:
            if (inputChar == '"') return JsonParseState.ObjectKeyStart;
            if (inputChar == '}') return JsonParseState.End; // Empty object
            // ... whitespace ...
            break;
        case JsonParseState.ObjectKeyStart:
            if (char.IsLetterOrDigit(inputChar) || inputChar == '_') return JsonParseState.ObjectKey;
            // ... error ...
            break;
        case JsonParseState.ObjectKey:
            if (inputChar == '"') return JsonParseState.Colon;
            if (char.IsLetterOrDigit(inputChar) || inputChar == '_') return JsonParseState.ObjectKey;
            // ... error ...
            break;
        // ... other state transitions ...
    }
    return currentState; // Or throw an error for unexpected input
}

private JsonValue? ParseInternal()
{
    var currentState = JsonParseState.Start;
    // ...

    for (_parsePosition = 0; _parsePosition < _parseLength; _parsePosition++)
    {
        char currentChar = _parseData[_parsePosition];
        currentState = GetNextState(currentState, currentChar);
        // Perform actions based on the new state
        // ...
        if (_parseException != null) break;
    }

    // Handle EOF based on the final currentState
    // ...

    return FinalizeParsing(currentState);
}
This is just a very basic illustration. Your actual state machine will be more complex.

Key Benefits of Refactoring:

Increased Readability: Code-driven logic is generally easier to follow than data tables, especially 
without proper documentation.

Improved Maintainability: Updating the parser for new JSON features or fixing bugs becomes more 
straightforward when the logic is explicit in the code.

Better Debugging: You can step through the code and understand exactly why the parser is making 
certain decisions.

Easier Collaboration: Other developers will find it easier to understand and contribute to the codebase.

This will be a significant undertaking, but the long-term benefits for your JSON library will be substantial.
Take it one step at a time, test frequently, and don't hesitate to ask for help or clarification as you go!
